The following are my reflections:

* What helped you understand DOM interaction best?
  Working directly with HTML elements and seeing live changes on the webpage was crucial. Using JavaScript to select and modify those elements helped my understanding of how the DOM works.

* How did you choose your milestone messages?
  I chose encouraging and fun messages to keep things light. The messages are unevenly spaced out to be unpredictable to the user.

* What challenge or bug surprised you?
  Initially, a typo in the element ID prevented the event listener from working. Although frustrating, this mistake helped me by making me slow down and analyze my code in order to debug.

* What personal twist did you add?
  I replaced the cookie with a rainbow emoji and used rainbow colors for the background. This twist celebrates Pride month even though it was technically last month.

* What real-world app uses this kind of interaction?
  Instagram and facebook use this kind of interaction. When users hit the "like" button, the color of the heart or thumbs up arrow changes and the like count is updated.
